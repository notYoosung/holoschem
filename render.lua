#### List of particlespawner properties

All properties in this list of type "vec3 range", "float range" or "vec3" can
be animated with `*_tween` tables. For example, `jitter` can be tweened by
setting a `jitter_tween` table instead of (or in addition to) a `jitter`
table/value.

In this section, a float range is a table defined as so: { min = A, max = B }
A and B are your supplemented values. For a vec3 range this means they are vectors.
Types used are defined in the previous section.

* vec3 range `pos`: the position at which particles can appear

* vec3 range `vel`: the initial velocity of the particle

* vec3 range `acc`: the direction and speed with which the particle
  accelerates

* float range `size`: scales the visual size of the particle texture.
  if `node` is set, this can be set to 0 to spawn randomly-sized particles
  (just like actual node dig particles).

* vec3 range `jitter`: offsets the velocity of each particle by a random
  amount within the specified range each frame. used to create Brownian motion.

* vec3 range `drag`: the amount by which absolute particle velocity along
  each axis is decreased per second.  a value of 1.0 means that the particle
  will be slowed to a stop over the space of a second; a value of -1.0 means
  that the particle speed will be doubled every second. to avoid interfering
  with gravity provided by `acc`, a drag vector like `vector.new(1,0,1)` can
  be used instead of a uniform value.

* float range `bounce`: how bouncy the particles are when `collisiondetection`
  is turned on. values less than or equal to `0` turn off particle bounce;
  `1` makes the particles bounce without losing any velocity, and `2` makes
  them double their velocity with every bounce.  `bounce` is not bounded but
  values much larger than `1.0` probably aren't very useful.

* float range `exptime`: the number of seconds after which the particle
  disappears.

* table `attract`: sets the birth orientation of particles relative to various
  shapes defined in world coordinate space. this is an alternative means of
  setting the velocity which allows particles to emerge from or enter into
  some entity or node on the map, rather than simply being assigned random
  velocity values within a range. the velocity calculated by this method will
  be **added** to that specified by `vel` if `vel` is also set, so in most
  cases **`vel` should be set to 0**. `attract` has the fields:

  * string `kind`: selects the kind of shape towards which the particles will
    be oriented. it must have one of the following values:

    * `"none"`: no attractor is set and the `attractor` table is ignored
    * `"point"`: the particles are attracted to a specific point in space.
      use this also if you want a sphere-like effect, in combination with
      the `radius` property.
    * `"line"`: the particles are attracted to an (infinite) line passing
      through the points `origin` and `angle`. use this for e.g. beacon
      effects, energy beam effects, etc.
    * `"plane"`: the particles are attracted to an (infinite) plane on whose
      surface `origin` designates a point in world coordinate space. use this
      for e.g. particles entering or emerging from a portal.

  * float range `strength`: the speed with which particles will move towards
    `attractor`. If negative, the particles will instead move away from that
    point.

  * vec3 `origin`: the origin point of the shape towards which particles will
    initially be oriented. functions as an offset if `origin_attached` is also
    set.

  * vec3 `direction`: sets the direction in which the attractor shape faces. for
    lines, this sets the angle of the line; e.g. a vector of (0,1,0) will
    create a vertical line that passes through `origin`. for planes, `direction`
    is the surface normal of an infinite plane on whose surface `origin` is
    a point. functions as an offset if `direction_attached` is also set.

  * ObjectRef `origin_attached`: allows the origin to be specified as an offset
    from the position of an entity rather than a coordinate in world space.

  * ObjectRef `direction_attached`: allows the direction to be specified as an
    offset from the position of an entity rather than a coordinate in world space.

  * bool `die_on_contact`: if true, the particles' lifetimes are adjusted so
    that they will die as they cross the attractor threshold. this behavior
    is the default but is undesirable for some kinds of animations; set it to
    false to allow particles to live out their natural lives.

* vec3 range `radius`: if set, particles will be arranged in a sphere around
  `pos`. A constant can be used to create a spherical shell of particles, a
  vector to create an ovoid shell, and a range to create a volume; e.g.
  `{min = 0.5, max = 1, bias = 1}` will allow particles to appear between 0.5
  and 1 nodes away from `pos` but will cluster them towards the center of the
  sphere. Usually if `radius` is used, `pos` should be a single point, but it
  can still be a range if you really know what you're doing (e.g. to create a
  "roundcube" emitter volume).
